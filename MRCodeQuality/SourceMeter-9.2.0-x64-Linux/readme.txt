SourceMeter 9.2
(https://www.sourcemeter.com)

FrontEndART SourceMeter is a source code analyzer tool, which can perform deep
static analysis of the source code of complex software systems implemented in
C/C++, Java, C#, Python, JavaScript or RPG programming languages.

The source code of a program is usually its only up-to-date documentation. At
the same time, the source code is the exquisite bearer of knowledge, business
processes and methodology, accumulated over a long period of time. Source code
quality decrease, which happens due to many quick fixes and time pressure,
results in the increase of development and testing costs, and operational
risks. In spite of this, the source code usually receives hostile treatment
and is merely considered as a tool.

FrontEndART has developed SourceMeter based on the Columbus technology
researched and developed at the Department of Software Engineering of the
University of Szeged. SourceMeter provides deep static analysis of source code.
Using the results of the analysis, the quality of the analyzed source code can
be improved and developed both in the short- and long term in a directed way.

Most features of SourceMeter are free, but some modules need a commercial
license.

Product characteristics

The most important product characteristics of SourceMeter are the following:
* Support for C++14, Java 8, C# 6.0, Python 2.7.x and 3.7.x, EcmaScript2017 (JavaScript), RPG III and IV
  (including free-form)
* Platform-independent command line tools
* Transparent integration into build processes
* Powerful filter management
* Coding issue detection
  - OWASP  vulnerability issues (for Java)
  - Runtime exception issues (for Java)
  - Android programming mistakes (for Java)
  - Common programming mistakes
  - Metric threshold violations
  - Integration of popular free tools (Cppcheck, PMD, SpotBugs, FxCop, Pylint, ESLint)
* Clone detection (copy-pasted source code fragments) extended with clone
  tracking and "clone smells"
  - Syntax-based, so-called Type-2 clones
* Metrics calculation at component, file, package/namespace, class, method,
  and function levels:
  - Source code metrics
  - Clone metrics
  - Coding rule violation metrics
  - Maintainability Index metrics (for Java and C/C++)

By continuous static analysis, the software developers can:
- reduce the software erosion rate and this way decrease development costs;
- coding problems can be identified before testing, so the number of test
  iterations and the testing costs can be reduced;
- the number of errors in delivered software can be reduced, so the
  operational risks can be decreased, increasing the company's reputation.

which can be found in the CPP, Java, CSHARP, Python, JavaScript, and RPG subdirectories
of the package.
