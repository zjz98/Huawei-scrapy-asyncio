deprecations:
  - |
    Allow users to add additional exchanges in ceilometer.conf instead of
    hardcoding exchanges. Now original http_control_exchanges is being deprecated
    and renamed notification_control_exchanges. Besides, the new option is integrated
    with other exchanges in default EXCHANGE_OPTS to make it available to extend
    additional exchanges.
