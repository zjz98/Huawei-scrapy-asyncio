    A local cache is used when polling instance metrics to minimise calls Nova
    API. A new option is added `resource_cache_expiry` to configure a time to
    live for cache before it expires. This resolves issue where migrated
    instances are not removed from cache. This is only relevant when
    `instance_discovery_method` is set to `naive`. It is recommended to use
    `libvirt_metadata` if possible.
