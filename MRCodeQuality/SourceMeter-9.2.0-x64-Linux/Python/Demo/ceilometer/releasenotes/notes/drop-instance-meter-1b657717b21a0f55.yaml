prelude: >
    Samples are required to measure some aspect of a resource. Samples not
    measuring anything will be dropped.
upgrade:
  - The `instance` meter no longer will be generated. For equivalent
    functionality, perform the exact same query on any compute meter such as
    `cpu`, `disk.read.requests`, `memory.usage`, `network.incoming.bytes`,
    etc...
deprecations:
  - The `instance` meter no longer will be generated.
