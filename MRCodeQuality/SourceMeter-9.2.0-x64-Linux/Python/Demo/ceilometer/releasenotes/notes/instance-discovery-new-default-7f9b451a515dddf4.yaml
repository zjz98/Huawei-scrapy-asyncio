    Ceilometer legacy backends and Ceilometer API are now deprecated. Polling
    all nova instances from compute agent is no more required with Gnocchi. So
    we switch the [compute]instance_discovery_method to libvirt_metadata.
    To switch back to the old deprecated behavior you can set it back to 'naive'.
