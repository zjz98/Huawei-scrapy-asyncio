    The pipeline dynamic refresh code has been removed. Ceilometer relies on
    the cotyledon library for a few releases which provides reload
    functionality by sending the SIGHUP signal to the process. This achieves
    the same feature while making sure the reload is explicit once the file is
    correctly and entirely written to the disk, avoiding the failing load of
    half-written files.
