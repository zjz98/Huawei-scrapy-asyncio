upgrade:
  - Pipeline processing in polling agents was removed in Liberty cycle. A new
    polling specific definition file is created to handle polling functionality
    and pipeline definition file is now reserved exclusively for
    transformations and routing. The polling.yaml file follows the same syntax
    as the pipeline.yaml but only handles polling attributes such as interval,
    discovery, resources, meter matching. It is configured by setting cfg_file
    under the polling section.If no polling definition file is found, it will
    fallback to reuse pipeline_cfg_file.
