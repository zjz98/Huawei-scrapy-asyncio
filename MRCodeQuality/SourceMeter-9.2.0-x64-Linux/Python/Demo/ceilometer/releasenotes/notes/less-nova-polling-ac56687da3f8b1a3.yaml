features:
  - The Ceilometer compute agent can now retrieve some instance metadata from
    the metadata libvirt API instead of polling the Nova API. Since Mitaka,
    Nova fills this metadata with some information about the instance.
    To enable this feature you should set [compute]/instance_discovery_method =
    libvirt_metadata in the configuration file.

    The only downside of this method is that user_metadata (and some other
    instance attributes) are no longer part of the samples created by the
    agent. But when Gnocchi is used as backend, this is not an issue since
    Gnocchi doesn't store resource metadata aside of the measurements. And the
    missing informations are still retrieved through the Nova notifications
    and will fully update the resource information in Gnocchi.
upgrade:
  - If you are using Gnocchi as backend it's strongly
    recommended to switch [compute]/instance_discovery_method to
    libvirt_metadata. This will reduce the load on the Nova API
    especially if you have many compute nodes.
deprecations:
  - The [compute]/workload_partitioning = True is deprecated in favor
    of [compute]/instance_discovery_method = workload_partitioning
