=================================
 Ceilometer + Gnocchi Integration
=================================

.. warning::

    Remember that custom modification may result in conflicts with upstream upgrades.
    If not intended to be merged with upstream, it's advisable to directly create
    resource-types via Gnocchi API.

.. _resource_types:

Managing Resource Types
=======================

Resource types in Gnocchi are managed by Ceilometer. The following describes how to add/remove
or update Gnocchi resource types to support new Ceilometer data.

The modification or creation of Gnocchi resource type definitions are managed
:section:`resources_update_operations` of :file:`ceilometer/gnocchi_client.py`.

The following operations are supported:

1. Adding a new attribute to a resource type. The following adds `flavor_name` attribute
   to an existing `instance` resource:

.. code::

    {"desc": "add flavor_name to instance",
     "type": "update_attribute_type",
     "resource_type": "instance",
     "data": [{
         "op": "add",
         "path": "/attributes/flavor_name",
         "value": {"type": "string", "min_length": 0, "max_length": 255,
                   "required": True, "options": {'fill': ''}}
     }]}

2. Remove an existing attribute from a resource type. The following removes `server_group`
   attribute from `instance` resource:

.. code::

    {"desc": "remove server_group to instance",
     "type": "update_attribute_type",
     "resource_type": "instance",
     "data": [{
         "op": "remove",
         "path": "/attributes/server_group"
     }]}

3. Creating a new resource type. The following creates a new resource type named
   `nova_compute` with a required attribute `host_name`:

.. code::

    {"desc": "add nova_compute resource type",
     "type": "create_resource_type",
     "resource_type": "nova_compute",
     "data": [{
         "attributes": {"host_name": {"type": "string", "min_length": 0,
                        "max_length": 255, "required": True}}
     }]}

.. note::

    Do not modify the existing change steps when making changes. Each modification
    requires a new step to be added and for `ceilometer-upgrade --skip-metering-database`
    to be run to apply the change to Gnocchi.

With accomplishing sections above, don't forget to add a new resource type or attributes of
a resource type into :the file:`ceilometer/dispatcher/data/gnocchi_resources.yaml`.
